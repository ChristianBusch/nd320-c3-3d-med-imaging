# Segmentation Exercise

In this exercise you will use 3D slicer to create a ground truth segmentation of the spleen, as you have seen in the lesson video.

You will find the `spleen1_img.nii.gz` file next to this readme. You can refer to the video from the lesson to figure out where the spleen is.

Once you have created the most perfect segmentation of spleen, save it as NIFTI volume and load into your script from Lesson 3 where you were computing Dice scores.

Compute your performance metrics comparing your manual segmentation with ground truth and the one generated by our (insanely overfitting) neural network.

Did you do better than your Unet did?
