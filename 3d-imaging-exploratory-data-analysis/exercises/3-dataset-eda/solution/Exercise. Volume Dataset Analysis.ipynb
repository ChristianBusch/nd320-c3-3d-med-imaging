Rather, this dataset looks like somethign that you are likely to get as a raw dump from a clinical data archive.  \n",

    "1. What imaging modality was used to produce this dataset?\n",
    "1. Data from how many patients does the dataset include?\n",

    "1. List voxel dimensions of all 3D volumes (i.e. series) that the dataset contains as WxHxD\n",
